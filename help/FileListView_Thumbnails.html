This File List view displays the files in an archive as a series of thumbnails. When you open an archive, Game Extractor tries to load a small thumbnail image of each file in the archive. If it can't load a thumbnail for one of the files, it is shown as a generic file icon.
<br><br>
This file list view is great for archives that contain mostly images - if possible, Game Extractor will display thumbnails of each image, easily allowing you to see what the image is, without needing to extract them all. However, this also means that archives take longer to open.
