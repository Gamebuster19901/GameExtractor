Opens an archive on your computer, using a script file.
<br><br>
A list of files and directories will be displayed in the <a href="SidePanel.html" class="italic green">Side Panel</a>. At the bottom of the Side Panel, you can choose the script that you want to use for opening the archive. You can then either double-click a file in the list, or choose a file and click the Open Archive with Script button. Game Extractor will try to open the file using the script you have chosen.
<br><br>
Game Extractor supports BMS script files, which can be in MexCom3 or QuickBMS format. Scripts are loaded from the <i>scripts</i> folder where you installed Game Extractor. You can create your own scripts using the <a href="ScriptBuilder.html" class="italic green">Script Builder</a>, or if you double-click a BMS script on your PC, Game Extractor will ask whether you want to add it to the scripts collection.
<br><br>
Game Extractor can run MexCom3 scripts by itself, but QuickBMS needs to be installed if you want to run a QuickBMS script. When you try to use a QuickBMS script, Game Extractor will download the software if needed, or you can configure QuickBMS yourself by following <a href="ExternalSoftware.html" class="italic green">these instructions</a>.
