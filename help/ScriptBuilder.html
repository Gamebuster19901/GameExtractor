The Script Builder allows you to view and create your own scripts for <a href="ReadArchive_Script.html" class="italic green">Opening Archives with Script</a>.
<br><br>
The main field is where you write your script, or an existing script can be loaded from the dropdown list below. At the bottom, there is a list of the available commands - double clicking a command will insert it into your script.
<br><br>
When you have finished, you can check your script for syntax errors, and test it on an archive. When you are satisfied, you can save the script, allowing you to use it in Game Extractor at any time.
<br><br>
Game Extractor can natively handle MexCom3 BMS scripts, and that is what the Script Builder is designed for. If you have <a href="ExternalSoftware.html" class="italic green">QuickBMS</a> installed and connected to Game Extractor, it can also read and process QuickBMS scripts.
