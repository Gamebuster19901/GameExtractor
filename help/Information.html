Displays information about the current archive and selected files.
<br><br>
The top table shows information about the current archive. The middle table shows information about the selected file (or files) in the <a href="FileList.html" class="italic green">File List</a>. The bottom table shows a list of all plugins that might be capable of loading this archive in Game Extractor.
<br><br>
Game Extractor tries to pick the correct plugin for an archive, but occasionally it will get it wrong, because there are so many similar types of archives out there. If the archive isn't opened correctly by the default plugin, you should consider using one of the other plugins in the bottom list, as they are all identified as being potential plugins for opening an archive. Double-clicking one of the plugins in the list will open the archive using the plugin you chose. The plugins with the highest percentage have the best chance of opening the archive correctly.
